# Semantic_similarity.ipynb (not working as desired)
A python script that, given the whole [Gene Ontology basic obo file](https://current.geneontology.org/ontology/go-basic.obo) and the [human gaf file](https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/GO/goa/HUMAN/) first appoints each human Gene Ontology term to one of three dictionaries (P = Biological Process, F = Molecular Function, C = Cellular Component). Afterwords, it reduces the GO terms for each gene by calculating the Reskind semantic similarity metric by pairwise comparing the semantic similarity of the GO terms associated with each gene.
# Semantic_similarity.R (working as intended)
Script that functions as intended. Firstly, given the whole [Gene Ontology basic obo file](https://current.geneontology.org/ontology/go-basic.obo) and the [human gaf file](https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/GO/goa/HUMAN/), it filters out rows that contain 'NOT' in Qualifier column or 'C' or 'F' on the Aspect column (we are only interested in P, meaning Biological Process). Then it performs GO term reduction based on the semantic similarity of the terms of each ID. Using the GOSemSim R package we can perform this analysis using various semantic similarity measures ("Resnik", "Lin", "Rel", "Jiang", "TCSS" or "Wang" methods) to further validate our results. We can also easily change the semantic similarity threshold and observe the differences. The levels file contains the level of each go term (a metric for the generality or specificity of the term) and it can be generated using the python code in the levels.py script.
